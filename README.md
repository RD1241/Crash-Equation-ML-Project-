# 🚦 Crash Equation  
## Machine Learning for Road Safety & Risk Analysis

Crash Equation is a **machine learning project** focused on analyzing large-scale road accident data to predict **injury severity** and **driver fault**.  
The project demonstrates how **data-driven models** can support real-world decision-making in areas such as **road safety, insurance analysis, and emergency response systems**.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Road accidents generate massive amounts of data, but extracting **actionable insights** from this data is challenging.

This project aims to answer two key questions:

1. **How severe will the injuries be in a given accident scenario?**
2. **Who is most likely at fault based on available features?**

By applying machine learning techniques, the project explores how predictive models can help analyze accident dynamics and outcomes.
